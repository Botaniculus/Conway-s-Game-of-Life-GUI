## Key shortcuts
`Space` pause and resume the game;  
`Backspace` clear and pause the game;  
`r`(`R`) generate random patterns;  
`+`/`-` speed up or slow down the game;  

## Grid
When you reach any of the edges, squares from the opposite edge will be counted as your neighbours. I'm not very good at explaining this, but wikipedia explains it clearly:
>A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge.
